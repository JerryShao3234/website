  <p>The usage of gunpowder, especially in man portable weapons, forever changed the ways wars were fought. The firepower granted to the individual infantryman outgunned, outranged, and outperformed his medival counterpart.
  These weapons first came in the form of muskets, a type of smoothbore firearm that although took rather long to reload could penetrate any form of personal armour at a significant distance.
  Muskets gradually evolved over time, being perfected by each nation that used them in their armies. Gradually, rifles replaced muskets as they offered 2 major advantages: shorter
  reloading times and accuracy at range. However, the usage of rifles was still limited by the skill and endurance of the human gunner behind it.</p>
  
  <p>Some solutions have come up over the years. There were many attempts at "repeating firearms", guns that often used revolving chambers to feed the next round in. This however
  were inherently limited by the small sizes of the the cylinders which contained the rounds. Others used "volley fire" techniques, which used multiple barrels to increase firerate. 
  These however would rarely be man portable.</p> 
 
  
  <p>As a Computer Engineer, everything here impresses me because I could never think of these mechanical solutions or even concepts let alone build working prototypes and use them to set records.</p>
  <p>I hope you are fascinated by these inventions as much as I am.</p>
