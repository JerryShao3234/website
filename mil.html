  <p>One of the oldest and most important applications of engineering was in warfare. Engineers pioneered the road of advancing mechanics, themodynamics, and electronics into 
  world-changing designs. Much of civilian technology actually is derived from their military applications. Although some of these machines and concepts are now considered obsolete, they were revolutionary for their time and deserve to be known and respected by all future engineers.</p>
