  <h1>Automatic Firearms</h1>

  <p>The usage of gunpowder, especially in man portable weapons, forever changed the ways wars were fought. The firepower granted to the individual infantryman outgunned, outranged, and outperformed his medival counterpart.
  These weapons first came in the form of muskets, a type of smoothbore firearm that although took rather long to reload could penetrate any form of personal armour at a significant distance.
  Muskets gradually evolved over time, being perfected by each nation that used them in their armies. Gradually, rifles replaced muskets as they offered 2 major advantages: shorter
  reloading times and accuracy at range. However, the usage of rifles was still limited by the skill and endurance of the human gunner behind it.</p>
  
  <p>Some solutions have come up over the years. There were many attempts at "repeating firearms", guns that often used revolving chambers to feed the next round in. This however
  were inherently limited by the small sizes of the the cylinders which contained the rounds. Others used "volley fire" techniques, which used multiple barrels to increase firerate. 
  A major drawback to this was the portability, or lack thereof, in these designs. This would all change in 1884 when a British engineer named Sir Henry Maxim invented the "Maxim Gun". </p> 
  
  <p>In many ways, the Maxim Gun was the first practical implementation of an automatic firearm. It used a recoil operated mechanism would would use the expanding gases left by a round to load 
  the next one in. It was also belt-fed and water-cooled, which allowed for a much greater volume of fire to be expended. Most importantly, it removed the "human powered" bottleneck of reloading
  individual rounds, achieving a firerate of 550-600 rounds per minute. It would be used by the British in great effect to aid in their colonisation efforts, but its devastating effects on World War I
  would truly cement the achievement in military history. </p>
  
  <p>Obviously, the British and their Allies were not the only nations to see the importance of machineguns on the battlefield. Germany was quick in improving the design, eventually culminating
  in the infamous MG42, a gun that fired so fast that individual shots could not be distinguished, giving it the apt nickname of "Hitler's Buzzsaw" by Allied troops. Testing showed
  that it could actually fire 1500 rounds per minute. In fact, the design of the MG42 is still in use my many European countries today, and has inspired the design of many of its successors. </p>
  
  <p>Soviet and American designers increased the calibre of machineguns from that of standard rifles. These 12.7mm (or .50 cal's) guns could shoot farther and penetrate more. This 
  would allow them to better supress enemy defenses as well as allow them to be used on aircraft, both as defensive and offensive measures. The Soviet design, the DShK, is still in use 
  today, as is the American M2 Browning, in various roles across the world.</p>
  
  <p>Machineguns would not be the final automatic weapon. During World War II there was a large emphasis on giving the individual soldier the close-range firepower of a machinegun,
  which lead to the design of submachineguns. These were essentially handheld automatic weapons that would fire as fast as a machinegun but hit as hard as a pistol. In the skies,
  plane designers frequently stepped up the calibre of automatic weapons, leading to 15mm, 20mm, and even 37mm autocannons mounted in various fighters and ground-attack planes. Today,
  assault rifles have largely replaced rifles by drastically increasing the firerate but slightly limiting their effective engagement range. Perhaps the most famous assault rifles today are the 
  Soviet AK family and the American AR family.</p>
